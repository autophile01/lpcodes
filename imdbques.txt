- **Code Explaination**
    
    ```python
    from keras.datasets import imdb
    ```
    
    - **`from`**: This is a keyword in Python used to import specific parts of a module.
    - **`keras.datasets`**: This is the module path. **`keras`** is a high-level neural networks API, and **`datasets`** is a submodule within Keras that provides access to various datasets for machine learning.
    - Keras is an open-source neural network library written in Python. It is designed to be user-friendly, modular, and extensible. Keras provides a high-level interface for building and training neural networks, making it easier for users to experiment with deep learning models without needing to understand the low-level details of implementing neural networks.
    - **`import imdb`**: This line imports the IMDb movie reviews dataset, which is a popular dataset for sentiment analysis tasks. **`imdb`** is a submodule within **`keras.datasets`** that specifically provides access to the IMDb dataset.
    
    ```python
    from keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
    ```
    
    - Similar to the first line, this line imports another submodule from Keras called **`preprocessing.sequence`**.
    - **`import pad_sequences`**: This imports the **`pad_sequences`** function from the **`preprocessing.sequence`** submodule. This function is commonly used to pad sequences to a specified length in machine learning tasks, especially when dealing with text data.
    
    ```python
    max_len = 250
    X_train = pad_sequences(X_train, maxlen=max_len)
    X_test = pad_sequences(X_test, maxlen=max_len)
    ```
    
    1. `max_len = 250`: This line defines a variable named `max_len` and assigns it a value of 250. This variable represents the maximum length that sequences will be padded or truncated to.
    2. `X_train = pad_sequences(X_train, maxlen=max_len)`: This line applies padding to the sequences in the training data (`X_train`). Padding is a technique used to ensure that all sequences in a dataset have the same length. In this case, the `pad_sequences` function is used to pad or truncate sequences in `X_train` so that they all have a length of `max_len` (250 in this case). If a sequence is shorter than `max_len`, it will be padded with zeros at the beginning or truncated from the end to match the desired length.
    3. `X_test = pad_sequences(X_test, maxlen=max_len)`: This line performs the same operation as the previous line, but on the test data (`X_test`). It ensures that the sequences in the test data also have a length of `max_len`, consistent with the training data.
    
    ```python
    from keras.models import Sequential
    from keras.layers import Embedding, Bidirectional, LSTM, Dense
    ```
    
    - **`from keras.models import Sequential`**: This line imports the **`Sequential`** class from the **`models`** module of the Keras library. The **`Sequential`** class allows you to create models layer by layer.
    - **`from keras.layers import Embedding, Bidirectional, LSTM, Dense`**: This line imports specific layer classes from the **`layers`** module of Keras. These layers will be used to define the architecture of the neural network.
    
    ```python
    pythonCopy code
    embedding_dim = 128
    ```
    
    - This line defines a variable **`embedding_dim`** and sets it to 128. This variable represents the dimensionality of the embedding space. Embeddings are dense vectors representing words or tokens in a text.
    
    ```python
    pythonCopy code
    model = Sequential()
    ```
    
    - This line creates a new Sequential model object. The model will be constructed by adding layers to this object in sequence.
    
    ```python
    pythonCopy code
    model.add(Embedding(input_dim=10000, output_dim=embedding_dim, input_length=max_len))
    ```
    
    - **`model.add(Embedding(...))`**: This line adds an Embedding layer to the model.
    - **`input_dim=10000`**: This parameter specifies the size of the vocabulary, i.e., the maximum integer index that will be seen in the input data. In this case, it's set to 10,000, meaning the model will expect input data where each word has been encoded as an integer index up to 10,000.
    - **`output_dim=embedding_dim`**: This parameter specifies the dimension of the dense embedding. It is set to **`embedding_dim`**, which we defined earlier as 128.
    - **`input_length=max_len`**: This parameter specifies the length of input sequences. It's important for the model to know the length of input sequences so that it can pad or truncate sequences as necessary. **`max_len`** is likely a variable that holds the maximum length of input sequences.
    
    ```python
    pythonCopy code
    model.add(Bidirectional(LSTM(64, return_sequences=True)))
    ```
    
    - **`model.add(Bidirectional(LSTM(...)))`**: This line adds a Bidirectional LSTM layer to the model. Bidirectional LSTMs process the input sequence both forwards and backwards, which can aid in capturing long-range dependencies in the data.
    - **`LSTM(64, return_sequences=True)`**: This creates an LSTM layer with 64 units and **`return_sequences=True`**. The **`return_sequences=True`** parameter indicates that this LSTM layer should return the full sequence of outputs for each timestep, rather than just the output at the last timestep. This is important because the next layer (another Bidirectional LSTM) requires sequences as input.
    
    ```python
    pythonCopy code
    model.add(Bidirectional(LSTM(64)))
    ```
    
    - Similar to the previous line, this adds another Bidirectional LSTM layer to the model. However, this LSTM layer does not have **`return_sequences=True`**, meaning it will only return the output at the last timestep rather than the full sequence.
    
    ```python
    pythonCopy code
    model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
    ```
    
    - This line adds a Dense layer to the model. A Dense layer is a fully connected layer where each input node is connected to each output node.
    - **`1`** is the number of units in the Dense layer, indicating that the output of this layer will be a single scalar value.
    - **`activation='sigmoid'`**: This specifies the activation function for the Dense layer. The sigmoid activation function squashes the output values to the range [0, 1], which is suitable for binary classification tasks. In this case, it's likely used because the model is being trained for binary classification.
    
    ```python
    model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
    ```
    
    - **`model.compile`**: This method configures the learning process of the model before training. It specifies the loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics to be used during training.
    - **`loss='binary_crossentropy'`**: This parameter specifies the loss function to be used. In this case, **`'binary_crossentropy'`** is used, which is commonly used for binary classification tasks.
    - **`optimizer='adam'`**: This parameter specifies the optimizer to be used during training. **`'adam'`** refers to the Adam optimizer, which is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm.
    - **`metrics=['accuracy']`**: This parameter specifies the evaluation metric(s) to be used during training and testing. In this case, **`'accuracy'`** is used, which calculates the accuracy of the model predictions.
    
    ```python
    pythonCopy code
    history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=128, epochs=3, validation_split=0.2)
    ```
    
    - **`model.fit`**: This method trains the model on the given training data.
    - **`X_train`** and **`y_train`**: These are the input features (X_train) and corresponding target labels (y_train) used for training the model.
    - **`batch_size=128`**: This parameter specifies the number of samples to be used for each gradient update during training. Here, it's set to 128.
    - **`epochs=3`**: This parameter specifies the number of epochs (iterations over the entire dataset) for which the model will be trained. Here, it's set to 3.
    - **`validation_split=0.2`**: This parameter specifies the fraction of the training data to be used as validation data. In this case, 20% of the training data will be used for validation during training.
    
    ```python
    pythonCopy code
    loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, batch_size=128)
    print("Test Loss:", loss)
    print("Test Accuracy:", accuracy)
    ```
    
    - **`model.evaluate`**: This method evaluates the trained model on the given test data and computes the loss and metrics specified during compilation.
    - **`X_test`** and **`y_test`**: These are the input features (X_test) and corresponding target labels (y_test) used for testing the model.
    - **`batch_size=128`**: This parameter specifies the batch size to be used during evaluation.
    - The **`loss`** and **`accuracy`** variables store the computed loss and accuracy values, respectively, on the test data.
    - Finally, the code prints out the test loss and test accuracy of the model.
